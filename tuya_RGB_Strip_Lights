Trying to get Tuya RGB Strip Lights working in Homebridge?
Help - Solved

This took me SOOO long and there is barely any information so I'm here to make things easy for you

Here are the config details to use with https://github.com/newbishme/homebridge-tuya

                "name": "Strip Light",
                "type": "RGBTWLight",
                "manufacturer": "Cotify",
                "model": "Smart Wifi Bulb Socket E26",
                "id": "[YOURID]",
                "key": "[YOURKEY]",
                "ip": "[IP OF DEVICE]",
                "dpPower": 20,
                "dpMode": 21,
                "dpBrightness": 22,
                "dpColorTemperature": 23,
                "dpColor": 24,
                "minWhiteColor": 29,
                "maxWhiteColor": 1000,
                "colorFunction": "HSB"
Pay close attention to the above config details as I had to do a lot of testing and changing that wasn't particularly well documented

To get your device ID and Key, there are a bunch of guides around, I wasn't able to snoop mine from the App as it's encrypted now, but you can get it from the api.tuya.com site.
